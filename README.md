# Won't Get Fooled Again
 A React-Native Javascript based Mobile Application I was hired to develop by a Sociology professor; the project is a game about Fake News Media that puts you, the player, in the role of someone who is trying to validate a number of claims about the local refugee population that have been circling in the run-up to a national election.
 I've worked with React-Native before, but this project finally gave me the impetus to dig in deep and make a fairly thorough project; you can find it on expo here: https://expo.io/@reithger/wontgetfooledagain and run it on your own mobile device if it's an Android (iOS doesn't like sharing their app distribution network, sadly.)
 Feel free to take pointers from the code or message me if you're interested in how I made this, it's surprisingly easy to get a mobile app started with the technologies that exist today.
