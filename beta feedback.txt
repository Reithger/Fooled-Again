___Bugs:
text cutoff on messenger iPhone
 - AI translation
images missing on iOS

***fixed***
button on iOS way too big detection range

___Changes:
smaller side-friends panel, make able to disappear/reappear?
puzzle: use '?' instead of 'True?'
more clear fail state at end if bad puzzle

___Suggestions:

more instructions on procedure
 - start in messenger, get sent to news and given direction
feedback on which responses are right/wrong? some non-direct feedback?
 - more ways to say why it's wrong, then the negative feedback is useful without trivializing
more informal chatter
music?
voices for accessibility
write your own story, pre-written bits and pieces
